Question -> ❓ What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?
Assistant
Thought -> 💭 Thought: The query asks for the elevation range of the area where the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends. I need to find information about the Colorado orogeny, specifically its eastern sector, and then determine the elevation range of that area. I will start by using Wikipedia to get general information about the Colorado orogeny.
Action Planned🛠️: wikipedia
Reason📋: Wikipedia is a good starting point for general information about geological features like the Colorado orogeny.
Input✏️: Colorado orogeny

  "query": "Colorado orogeny",
  "title": "Colorado orogeny",
  "summary": "The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas. This took place from 1780 to 1650 million years ago (Mya), during the Paleoproterozoic (Statherian Period). It is recorded in the Colorado orogen, a >500-km-wide belt of oceanic arc rock that extends southward into New Mexico. The Colorado orogeny was likely part of the larger Yavapai orogeny."

Thought -> 💭 Thought: The Wikipedia article provides information about the Colorado orogeny's timing and location, but it doesn't mention anything about the elevation range of the area it affected, especially the eastern sector. The article mentions that the orogen extends southward into New Mexico, but this doesn't give specific elevation information for the eastern sector. I need to find a source that discusses the geographical extent of the *eastern* sector of the Colorado orogeny and its corresponding elevations. A Google search might help me find more specific information about the eastern sector and its elevation range.
Action Planned🛠️: google
Reason📋: Google search might provide more detailed information about the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny and its elevation range.

Thought -> 💭 Thought: The Google search results for "elevation range High Plains" provide a range of elevations. The first result from Wikipedia states the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,500 to 6,000 ft (460 to 1,830 m). The second result from Britannica states the altitude at the base of the Rockies is between 5,000 and 6,000 feet (1,500 and 1,800 metres). The third result from USGS mentions an elevation of about 7,800 feet. I will take the lowest and highest values to provide a comprehensive range. Thus, the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into is approximately 1,500 to 7,800 feet.
